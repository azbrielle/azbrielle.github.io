## Best Summer Ever

There was nothing Elizabeth liked better than spring and summer. She could finally shake off the winter blues and start planning fun summer activities. She especially loved the pool, biking, and ice cream. Right now, Elizabeth was making a list.

Elizabeth laid on her bed thinking about summer. The thought made her smile. But she was shaken from her thoughts when her Mom excitedly called, "Kids! Come here a minute!" 
Elizabeth crept down the stairs to the living room where her parents sat. When Elizabeth and all six of her siblings were seated, Mom said, "Kids, I just got a call from our adoption consultant, and she said that there's a baby girl in Utah who needs a home, and she's ours if we want her." 
"Really! That's awesome!" Elizabeth exclaimed, hugging her Mom. 
"When are you leaving?" her sixteen-year-old sister, Tania asked.
"As soon as we can get a flight." Dad replied. 
Mom got up, and went downstairs to get suitcases for her and Dad. Elizabeth could hear Mom calling our grandparents from her room where she had started to pack. 
     The next several days were a blur of Mom and Dad leaving, Elizabeth's grandparents coming over to take care of them, and Skyping Mom and Dad after they arrived in Utah. They wouldn't give any details about the baby until the legal papers were signed. The day the birthmother was supposed to sign the papers giving the baby to Elizabeth's family was sort of stressful. Elizabeth couldn't stop thinking about her hopefully new little sister. Then the text came. Later, Elizabeth couldn't remember most of what it said, but she did remember jumping and squealing when she heard the last line: She is ours. Later that day the picture came. The baby was so pretty. She had lots of brown hair, and her eyes looked almost Asian. Under the picture Mom had typed, 
Welcome Naomi Rebekah Marilson. 6 pounds and 6 ounces of sweetness.
Then the day came when Mom and Dad got to come home. The second their car stopped in the driveway Elizabeth and her siblings crowded around it, hugging their parents and Naomi. Tania, being the oldest, got to hold Naomi first. When it was Elizabeth's turn, she cuddled Naomi close. Suddenly Naomi opened her eyes and looked curiously up at Elizabeth. 
"Hi Naomi." Elizabeth giggled. 
Naomi snuggled up to Elizabeth and went to sleep again. 
"Best summer ever." Elizabeth whispered to baby Naomi, “I have a lot of fun things planned for us this summer!”
